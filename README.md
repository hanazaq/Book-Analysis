# Book-Analysis
Help readers to find their books according to previous readers' interactions on Twitter and Goodreads.
# Library that I used:
1_ Tweepy: collect data from Twitter
2_ Numpy and Pandas: clean,analyze,and preset data in quick charts and tables
3_ Flask with HTML and CSS: create website and link between the screens effectively
4_ Charts js: present charts on the website that are easy to read
