# Book-Analysis
Help readers to find their books according to previous readers' interactions on Twitter and Goodreads.
Library that I used:
Tweepy: collect data from Twitter
Numpy and Pandas: clean,analyze,and preset data in quick charts and tables
Flask with HTML and CSS: create website and link between the screens effectively
Charts js: present charts on the website that are easy to read
